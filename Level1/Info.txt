Development Goals in Verilog for Basys3 Timer

This outline details the functionalities we aim to achieve in Verilog for a timer implemented on a Basys3 FPGA board. We'll focus on achieving these goals in stages.

Level 1:

    Reset:
        The timer synchronously resets to 00:00.0 on a high reset signal.
    Start/Stop:
        Pressing Start initiates counting upwards from 00:00.0.
        Counting increments tenths of seconds, seconds, and minutes.
        It wraps around at 9:59.9 and continues counting from 00:00.0.
        A high Stop signal pauses the counting process and freezes the displayed time.
        Pressing Start while stopped resumes counting upwards from the stopped value.
    Clear (while stopped):
        A high Clear signal while stopped resets the display to 00:00.0 and maintains the stopped state.
